## 🤔 What Is This?

**Swarm Command** is a multi-model swarm orchestration skill for the [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) that launches **50 to 250+ AI agents** across **16 different models** to solve complex tasks through hierarchical fan-out, cross-family review, and consensus-gated synthesis.

Give it a task — architecture, refactoring, testing, docs, or integration — and it decomposes the mission into domains, dispatches commanders, squad leads, and workers, validates outputs against sealed acceptance criteria, and synthesizes a final answer from collective intelligence instead of single-model intuition.

### 💬 The Problem

One model gives you **one perspective**.

For small tasks, that's perfect. For high-stakes tasks, it's fragile:

- the model may miss cross-cutting risks,
- the task may exceed one context window,
- the output may sound confident without being complete,
- and you have no independent check that the answer actually satisfies the mission.

Swarm Command solves that by turning one request into a **structured swarm process**: split, parallelize, review, validate, converge.

---

## 🚀 30-Second Overview

**Swarm Command** is for tasks that are too big, risky, or cross-cutting for one model:

- **Need one answer from many perspectives?** It fans your task out across a layered swarm.
- **Need confidence, not vibes?** It uses cross-review + consensus scoring.
- **Need hidden quality checks?** It validates bundles with sealed acceptance criteria.
- **Need speed at scale?** It grows sub-linearly: **5× more agents ≈ 2.2× more wall-clock time**.
- **Need zero setup?** No servers, no API keys, no build step.

If your task spans **architecture + implementation + testing + docs + integration**, this is exactly what Swarm Command is built for.

## 🎬 Quick Demo

### Representative CLI transcript

```text
$ copilot

> swarm command ss-100 "Document the auth system, add missing tests, and flag rollout risks"

[NEXUS] Booting SS-100 swarm...
[NEXUS] Sealing acceptance criteria (8 checks)
[CMD-ARCH] Mapping auth boundaries and module ownership
[CMD-IMPL] Tracing token issuance, refresh, and revocation flows
[CMD-TEST] Enumerating missing happy-path, edge-case, and failure-path tests
[CMD-DOCS] Drafting operator-facing docs and examples
[CMD-INTG] Checking rollout risks across API, web, DB, and monitoring
[REVIEW] Cross-family review mesh started
[SHADOW] 1 criterion failed on first pass → hardening cycle triggered
[SHADOW] Re-validated bundle: 0 critical failures remaining

✅ Final bundle ready in 47s

Top outputs:
1. Auth architecture brief with module boundaries
2. Ranked test-gap list with highest-risk paths first
3. Rollout checklist covering cookies, refresh tokens, and observability
4. Updated docs outline for onboarding + operations

Consensus: CONSENSUS on 3/4 major findings
Shadow Score: 12.5% → hardened and accepted
```

**Good first prompt:**

```text
swarm command "Map this repo, explain how the major systems fit together, and list the 5 highest-risk gaps"
```

## 🥊 Swarm Command vs. Stampede vs. Havoc-Hackathon

These systems are complementary — not competitors.

| If you need to... | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Solve **one complex task** with layered consensus inside your current Copilot CLI session | [**Swarm Command**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/swarm-command) | Best when you want decomposition, cross-model review, shadow validation, and one synthesized answer |
| Run **parallel coding workstreams** across terminals or branches | [**Stampede**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/terminal-stampede) | Best when the goal is execution throughput across independent task lanes |
| Run a **many-model tournament** to pressure-test ideas and rank options | [**Havoc-Hackathon**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/havoc-hackathon) | Best when you want competitive ideation, elimination rounds, and judged synthesis |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Choose [**Swarm Command**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/swarm-command) for **consensus execution**.
- Choose [**Stampede**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/terminal-stampede) for **parallel implementation**.
- Choose [**Havoc-Hackathon**](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/havoc-hackathon) for **idea tournaments and comparative judging**.

## ⚡ What Makes It Different

- 🐝 **True swarm** — 50 to 250+ agents, not 3–5
- 🏗️ **5-layer hierarchy** — Nexus → Commander → Squad Lead → Worker → Reviewer
- 🔀 **Cross-model diversity** — Claude + GPT families mixed within every pod
- 🗳️ **Consensus scoring** — 4-stage gate-then-rank with CONSENSUS / MAJORITY / CONFLICT tiers
- 👻 **Shadow Score** — [Shadow Score Spec](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/shadow-score-spec) L2 conformance. Sealed acceptance criteria generated before commanders execute, validated after, hardened on failure.
- 🛡️ **Depth Guard** — 5 laws + 3-layer enforcement prevent runaway agent spawning
- ⚡ **Circuit breaker** — 3-state FSM with 5-level recovery escalation
- 📉 **Sub-linear scaling** — 5× more agents ≈ 2.2× more wall-clock time (α ≈ 0.45)
- 📦 **Zero infrastructure** — no servers, no API keys, no build step

### 🗒️ Field Notes

> **“Three sealed judges scored the design 44–46/50. Shadow scoring still caught critical arithmetic errors.”**
> That failure mode is why Swarm Command treats hidden validation as a first-class system, not a nice-to-have.

> **“5× more agents only costs ~2.2× more wall-clock time.”**
> The architecture is built for parallelism first, then convergence.

## 🧠 30-Second Architecture

Before the full diagrams, here's the mental model:

1. **Nexus** reads the mission and splits it into domains.
2. **Commanders** own each domain and dispatch sub-work.
3. **Workers** do tiny atomic tasks in parallel.
4. **Reviewers + Shadow Score** decide what survives into the final answer.

```text
You ask one question
        ↓
Nexus decomposes the mission
        ↓
Commanders split by domain
        ↓
Workers execute atomic tasks in parallel
        ↓
Reviewers score + Shadow Score validates
        ↓
Nexus emits one final bundle
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need API keys or infrastructure?
No. Swarm Command runs through your active Copilot subscription. No separate servers, queues, or key management required.

### When should I use SS-50, SS-100, or SS-250?
Use **SS-50** for bounded, fast tasks. Use **SS-100** for most real software work. Use **SS-250** when the task is repo-wide, high-stakes, or needs maximum coverage and consensus.

### Why mix Claude and GPT models?
Because diversity helps. Different model families catch different failure modes. Swarm Command intentionally mixes them so agreement means more than self-consistency.

### What happens when agents disagree?
Disagreement is preserved, scored, and escalated. Squad Leads and Commanders mark results as **CONSENSUS**, **MAJORITY**, **CONFLICT**, or **UNIQUE**, then Nexus arbitrates the unresolved pieces.

### What is Shadow Score in one sentence?
It is a hidden acceptance test: criteria are generated before execution, kept sealed from the swarm, then used to validate outputs afterward.

### Will this write code automatically?
It can produce plans, analyses, patches, documentation, tests, and rollout guidance depending on how you invoke it — but the point is not blind automation. The point is **reviewable, consensus-backed output**.

### When should I avoid using it?
Avoid it for tiny edits, urgent incident response where every second matters, or tasks that need one strong voice rather than many perspectives.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

Swarm Command came out of a simple question: **what if one Copilot CLI session could behave less like one assistant and more like a disciplined organization?**

The design evolved from **SwarmSpeed 250** experiments into a layered system with:

- a single **Nexus** orchestrator,
- domain-owning **Commanders**,
- decomposing **Squad Leads**,
- leaf-node **Workers**,
- and independent **Reviewers**.

The turning point was a self-analysis run later documented in [docs/shadow-scoring.md](docs/shadow-scoring.md): sealed judges rated a design highly **even though it contained critical arithmetic errors**. That exposed a core truth of multi-agent systems: **review alone is not validation**.

That failure drove the big ideas that now define this repo:

- **Shadow scoring** so hidden criteria can catch what the swarm forgot to optimize for
- **Depth Guard** so recursion never turns into agent explosion
- **Token compression** so higher-level intent survives while lower layers stay cheap
- **Cross-family review** so agreement means more than “the same model said it twice”

In other words: Swarm Command is not just a big swarm. It is a swarm that learned from its own failure modes.

---

## 👻 Shadow Scoring

Swarm Command implements **[Shadow Score Spec](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/shadow-score-spec) L2 conformance** — sealed acceptance criteria generated before commanders execute, validated after, hardened on failure.

**Formula:** `Shadow Score = (sealed_failures / sealed_total) × 100`

| Shadow Score | Level | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0% | ✅ Perfect | All sealed criteria passed |
| 1–15% | 🟢 Minor | Proceed normally |
| 16–30% | 🟡 Moderate | Attach Gap Report, warn |
| 31–50% | 🟠 Significant | Quarantine bundle, hardening cycle |
| > 50% | 🔴 Critical | Reject bundle from synthesis |

**Sealed-envelope protocol:**
1. **Phase 1.5** — Nexus generates sealed acceptance criteria from the task
2. **Phases 2–5** — Commanders execute without seeing those criteria
3. **Phase 6** — Validate outputs, compute Shadow Score, produce Gap Report
4. **Hardening** — If score > 15%, share failure messages only for one fix cycle

See [docs/shadow-scoring.md](docs/shadow-scoring.md) for the full protocol.

---

## 🗳️ Consensus Algorithm

A 4-stage consensus pipeline merges the best work from hundreds of agents:

1. **Worker Self-Score** — Each worker emits confidence + self-score with its atom
2. **Squad Lead Local Merge** — Groups atoms by sub-task, classifies as CONSENSUS / MAJORITY / CONFLICT
3. **Commander Domain Merge** — Trimmed mean across squads, applies the consensus formula
4. **Nexus Cross-Domain Synthesis** — Median-of-3 judging and final arbitration

**Consensus formula:**
```text
score = 0.40 × confidence + 0.30 × evidence + 0.15 × scope + 0.15 × coverage − min(0.30, conflict_rate × 0.30)
```

| Tier | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **CONSENSUS** | ≥ 70% agreement | Auto-accept |
| **MAJORITY** | ≥ 50% agreement | Accept with dissent note |
| **CONFLICT** | < 50% agreement | Nexus arbitration |
| **UNIQUE** | No overlap | Keep if evidence ≥ 0.70 |

See [docs/consensus.md](docs/consensus.md) for the full mechanics.
